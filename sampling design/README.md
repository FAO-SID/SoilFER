Guidelines and Technical Manual for Soil Sampling Design in SoilFER
This folder contains the material to produce a Soil Sampling Design, taking information from Honduras as an example, using the three-stage sample procedure proposed at Soils4Africa.Access to the Soils4Africa sampling design protocol: [https://www.soils4africa-h2020.eu/serverspecific/soils4africa/images/Documents/Soils4Africa_D3.2B_Sampling_design_v01.pdf]

The environmental covariates for Honduras must be retrieved from GGE using the code in gee.txt
