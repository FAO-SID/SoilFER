### **Process for Using ChatGPT to Interpret Cluster Analysis Classes**

This guide provides a step-by-step recipe for using ChatGPT to interpret cluster analysis classes, as demonstrated in the provided example. The process is designed to help soil experts understand site-specific characteristics for field visits.

---

### **Step 1: Define the Purpose**
- Clearly state that the goal is to interpret the classes of a cluster analysis to identify differences among them based on a set of environmental variables.

---

### **Step 2: Prepare Your Data**
1. **Perform Cluster Analysis**: Ensure you have conducted a cluster analysis and categorized your data into classes.
2. **List the Variables**: Prepare a complete list of the variables used for clustering.
   - Include the variable names and provide clear definitions or explanations.
   - For coded variable names, decode and explain the abbreviations.

Example:
- Variable: `ndvi_030405_250m_sd`
  - Decoded: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, representing the standard deviation for March-May at 250m resolution.

---

### **Step 3: Generate a Summary of Variables**
- Include summary statistics (e.g., min, max, mean, quartiles) for each variable across all classes.
- This helps ChatGPT (or any interpreter) understand the range and distribution of the data.

---

### **Step 4: Craft the Initial Prompt**
Write a prompt to guide ChatGPT in analyzing the data. The prompt should:
1. **Explain the Context**:
   - Mention that the analysis involves soil sampling sites classified into classes using specific variables.
2. **List the Variables**:
   - Provide the names and definitions of all variables used.
3. **Describe the Classes**:
   - Specify that the task is to identify differences among classes based on the combinations of variable values.
4. **Include the Summary Statistics**:
   - Share the descriptive statistics to give ChatGPT a reference for interpreting the data.

Example Prompt:
```
I need to interpret the classes of a cluster analysis and want you to help me identify what is different about each class. Here is the data:

Variables used for clustering:
1. ndvi_030405_250m_sd: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for March-May (standard deviation, 250m resolution)
2. snow_cover: Mean percentage of snow cover per year
...

Summary statistics:
Variable 1 (ndvi_030405_250m_sd): Min=779.0, Max=1386.0, Mean=1080.7
Variable 2 (snow_cover): Min=0%, Max=0%, Mean=0%
...
```

---

### **Step 5: Engage ChatGPT for Analysis**
- Ask ChatGPT to identify and interpret the differences among the classes.
- Use direct language, such as: 
   > “Based on the provided data, identify key distinguishing features of each class.”

---

### **Step 6: Review and Refine Results**
- Validate the interpretations provided by ChatGPT by cross-checking with your knowledge of the variables and classes.
- Highlight any insights that will be particularly useful for soil experts in the field.

---

### **Step 7: Summarize for Your Audience**
- Create a clear and concise report of the interpreted differences for each class.
- Focus on:
  - Key characteristics of each class
  - Practical implications for soil experts

---

### **Step 8: Prepare for Field Use**
- Provide field experts with a summary table or descriptive notes on each class.
- Ensure all technical terms are well-explained and relevant insights are highlighted.

**Prompt 1**:
```
I need to interpret the classes of a cluster analysis and want you to help me to identify what is different from each class of the cluster.
First let me explain you what is the data from:
I applied a cluster analysis to 26 soil sampling sites. To classify these sites into classes I used the following environmental variables:

Names of the environmental variables:
> vars
 [1] "fpar_030405_500m_sd"         "ndvi_030405_250m_sd"         "ndvi_120102_250m_sd"         "snow_cover"                  "flooded_vegetation"         
 [6] "grass"                       "dtm_downslopecurvature_250m" "dtm_mrn_250m"                "dtm_twi_500m"                "dtm_upslopecurvature_250m"  
[11] "bio13"                       "bio14"                       "ndvi_060708_250m_mean"       "ndvi_091011_250m_mean"       "dtm_elevation_250m" 

The names are codified as follow:

---
fpar is the Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation.
ndvi is the normalised difference vegetation index.

030405 are March, April and May: the number of months taken to aggregate 20 years of MODIS data.
250m_mean means that it was done at 250 m resolution and the aggregation function was the mean
250m_sd means that it was done at 250 m resolution and the aggregation function was the standard deviation

snow_cover is the mean percentage of occurrence of snow cover the year.
flooded_vegetation is the mean percentage of occurrence of flooded vegetation in the year.
grass is the mean percentage of occurrence of grass in the year
dtm are terrain attributes

From SAGA-GIS documentation:

dtm_downslopecurvature and dtm_upslopecurvature

Module Upslope and Downslope Curvature  
Calculates the local curvature of a cell as sum of the gradients to its neighbour cells. Upslope curvature is the distance weighted average local curvature in a cell's upslope contributing area based on multiple flow direction after Freeman 1994.

Melton Ruggedness Number
Author: O.Conrad (c) 2012
Menu: Terrain Analysis | Hydrology | Topographic Indices
Description
Melton ruggedness number (MNR) is a simple flow accumulation related index, calculated as difference between maximum and minimum elevation in catchment area divided by square root of catchment area size. The calculation is performed for each grid cell, therefore minimum elevation is same as elevation at cell's position. Due to the discrete character of a single maximum elevation, flow calculation is simply done with Deterministic 8.

SAGA Wetness Index
Author: J.Boehner, O.Conrad (c) 2001
Menu: Terrain Analysis | Hydrology | Topographic Indices
Description
The 'SAGA Wetness Index' is, as the name says, similar to the 'Topographic Wetness Index' (TWI), but it is based on a modified catchment area calculation ('Modified Catchment Area'), which does not think of the flow as very thin film. As result it predicts for cells situated in valley floors with a small vertical distance to a channel a more realistic, higher potential soil moisture compared to the standard TWI calculation.

bio layers

Bioclimatic variables
Bioclimatic variables are derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall values in order to generate more biologically meaningful variables. These are often used in species distribution modeling and related ecological modeling techniques. The bioclimatic variables represent annual trends (e.g., mean annual temperature, annual precipitation) seasonality (e.g., annual range in temperature and precipitation) and extreme or limiting environmental factors (e.g., temperature of the coldest and warmest month, and precipitation of the wet and dry quarters). A quarter is a period of three months (1/4 of the year).

They are coded as follows:

BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature

BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp))

BIO3 = Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (×100)

BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation ×100)

BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month

BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month

BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6)

BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter

BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter

BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter

BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter

BIO12 = Annual Precipitation

BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month

BIO14 = Precipitation of Driest Month

BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation)

BIO16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter

BIO17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter

BIO18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter

BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter

**Result**:

Thank you for providing detailed information about your cluster analysis and the environmental variables used. To interpret the differences between classes, we can focus on identifying patterns, trends, or outliers in each variable's values across clusters. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Cluster Summary**: If possible, share the mean, median, or representative values of each variable for each cluster. This will allow us to compare clusters directly.

2. **Key Differences**: 
    - Look for variables with extreme or distinct values within a cluster. For example, if a cluster has high `dtm_elevation_250m` and `ndvi_030405_250m_sd` values compared to others, it could represent a mountainous, vegetatively diverse area.
    - Identify clusters with unique combinations of variables, such as high `snow_cover` and `bio14` but low `flooded_vegetation`.

3. **Environmental Interpretation**: Map each cluster to its potential environmental context based on variable combinations. For example:
    - High `fpar_030405_500m_sd` and `ndvi` values could indicate areas with dense, variable vegetation.
    - High `bio13` and `dtm_twi_500m` values might represent wetter or more water-retentive environments.

4. **Spatial Analysis**: If possible, spatially map the clusters to visualize their geographical context. This can highlight patterns like elevation gradients, proximity to water bodies, or vegetation zones.

5. **Insights by Variable Groups**:
    - **Vegetation**: Compare `ndvi`, `fpar`, `grass`, and `flooded_vegetation` values.
    - **Terrain**: Use `dtm` variables like elevation, ruggedness (`dtm_mrn`), and curvatures to identify geomorphological characteristics.
    - **Climate**: Examine `bio13` and `bio14` for precipitation-related patterns.

### Next Steps:
To make interpretations specific to your clusters:
- Share summary statistics for each variable across clusters (means, ranges, or boxplots).
- Provide any notable trends you observe in the data.
- If spatial maps of clusters exist, those can provide further context.

Would you like to proceed with this approach? If you have specific cluster statistics or observations, please share them, and I’ll assist in identifying the unique characteristics of each class.

# **Prompt 2**

1. Estimate the **mean values** of each variable by cluster and add `_mean` at the end of each variable name. This provides the average value for each variable within a cluster. For example, `fpar_030405_500m_sd` becomes `fpar_030405_500m_sd_mean`.

2. Calculate the **standard deviation** for each variable within each cluster and add `_sd` to the end of the variable name. This represents the variability or heterogeneity of the variable within the cluster. For instance, `ndvi_030405_250m_sd` becomes `ndvi_030405_250m_sd_sd`.

3. Prepare a list of variables that includes the original variables with their `_mean` and `_sd` suffixes. For example:
   - `fpar_030405_500m_sd_mean`
   - `fpar_030405_500m_sd_sd`
   - `dtm_twi_500m_mean`
   - `dtm_twi_500m_sd`

4. Use consistent naming conventions for the variables to make it easy to distinguish between the mean and standard deviation values.

5. Provide the updated list of variables to ChatGPT so it can use these values for the cluster analysis.

**Example of Prompt 2**
```
To characterise each cluster, we estimated the mean of values of each variable by cluster adding _mean at the end of the name of each variable, e.g. fpar_030405_500m_sd_mean, dtm_twi_500m_mean, bio14_mean, etc.  Also, we compute the standard deviation of each variable for each cluster, so we can see the heterogeneity of the cluster. For this, we added _sd at the end of each variable, e.g. ndvi_030405_250m_sd_sd, flooded_vegetation_sd, dtm_mrn_250m_sd, etc.

This is the list of variables:

# **Prompt 3**

1. Ask ChatGPT to **focus the analysis on a single cluster** (Cluster 1 in this case) from the cluster analysis.

2. Group the interpretation into specific categories: **Vegetation**, **Hydrology**, **Topography**, and **Climate**. This organizes the analysis into meaningful environmental dimensions, making it easier to interpret.

3. Provide guidance to **write concisely** and **avoid bullet points**. This ensures the output is clear, professional, and readable in a paragraph format.

4. Instruct ChatGPT to compare the variable values of Cluster 1 against the **summary statistics** provided earlier. This helps in identifying distinguishing features or notable deviations for Cluster 1.

5. Share a single row of data (`test[1,]`) representing Cluster 1. Include all relevant variables with their values (e.g., means, standard deviations) to give ChatGPT the exact data to analyze.

6. Specify that the interpretation should consider both the **mean values** and **variability** (standard deviation) of the variables, ensuring a comprehensive analysis for each category.

**Example of Prompt 3**
```
Ok, now make an interpretation of Cluster 1 out of three. Group the analysis by characterizing: Vegetation, Hydrology, Topography, and Climate. Constrain the use of bullet points. Make the text concise and pay attention to the values of the variables regarding the summary statistics of all variables I gave you before.

```

**Result**:

```
### Vegetation
Cluster 1 exhibits moderate vegetation dynamics. The mean NDVI values, both in spring (`ndvi_030405_250m_sd_mean` = 1100.87) and winter (`ndvi_120102_250m_sd_mean` = 1597.73), are close to the median NDVI values in the dataset, suggesting relatively stable vegetation productivity. However, the standard deviations (`ndvi_030405_250m_sd_sd` = 153.07 and `ndvi_120102_250m_sd_sd` = 161.21) indicate moderate heterogeneity in vegetation cover within the cluster. Grass cover is relatively high (`grass_mean` = 6), with moderate variability (`grass_sd` = 1.96). This cluster has minimal flooded vegetation (`flooded_vegetation_mean` = 2.27), aligning with the lower quartile of the dataset.

### Hydrology
The hydrological conditions suggest moderately wet areas. The SAGA Wetness Index (`dtm_twi_500m_mean` = 105.07) is slightly above the dataset's median, indicating the potential for soil moisture retention in valley floors or flat areas. However, the standard deviation (`dtm_twi_500m_sd` = 8.01) implies variability in hydrological conditions. Precipitation metrics show intermediate values: the precipitation of the wettest month (`bio13_mean` = 259.95) and driest month (`bio14_mean` = 0.74) both fall near the dataset's median, reflecting balanced but not extreme hydrological conditions.

### Topography
